Here I'm exploring building a roguelike and 2d engine.

batteries included
------------------
* [odin-engine](https://github.com/schell/odin/tree/master/odin-engine) is a high
  level 2d game engine. It provides a novel effects system built on top of
  [freer](https://gitlab.com/queertypes/freer), as well as an immediate mode gui
  with a number of [preexisting widgets](https://github.com/schell/odin/tree/master/odin-engine/src/Odin/Engine/GUI).

* [gelatin-sdl2](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-sdl2)
  is the OpenGL/SDL2 rendering backend.

* [varying](https://github.com/schell/varying) provides smooth FRP-based
  animation.

* [shapes](https://github.com/ublubu/shapes) provides a purely function 2d
  collision detection and physics system.

* [mapmaker](https://github.com/schell/odin/blob/master/app/MapMaker.hs) is an
  example application written with `odin-engine`.
